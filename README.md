ls -la .env

# Verify key is set
cat .env | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

# Always activate first
source venv/bin/activate

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+
```

### Database Issues

# Reset database
rm data/tasks.db
python scripts/init_db.py
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x setup.sh main.py scripts/*.py
```
